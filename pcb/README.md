# GreyCat2K24 PCBs

Most libraries are from Hornet 9.0 (means you can find through Altium Component's manager) or from Altium Library Loader - But I should have tried to export as much as possible into standard libraries. You can try to install Altium Library Loader from the links below

PCBs are ordered through JLCPCB

Components in BOM to change in final order
1. for LED use 150060RS75000
2. for 470 ohm resistor instead of RT0805FRE07470RL use 0805W8F4700T5E
